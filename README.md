# Heart-Failure-Prediction

The analysis in this Jupyter Notebook is pretty vast and heavy so it might not load up on github completely, so if you want to see the analysis I'll advice you to download the file on your pc and then run it via Jupyter.
### A workaround
Try to open that notebook that you want using nbviewer online, you don't need to install it.

Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"
Paste the link to my notebook, "https://github.com/sahilsarin390/Heart-Failure-Prediction.git" there and then you get "https://nbviewer.org/github/sahilsarin390/Heart-Failure-Prediction/blob/main/Heart-Failure-Prediction.ipynb"
This site nbviewer works independently of github.
